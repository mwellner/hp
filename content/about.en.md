I am working as a software developer for [wer denkt was](https://werdenktwas.de) in Darmstadt.

Currently, my major hobby is theatre. I have been participating in more than ten productions in various theatre groups, starting in 2003. I was also doing improvisation theatre in a group for one year. And I was director for the first time, the play was [An ideal Husband](http://dramateure.ch/wordpress/produktionen/ein-idealer-gatte/) by Oscar Wilde.
