I am working as a software developer for [CONWEAVER](http://www.conweaver.com) in Darmstadt. 

Currently, my major hobby is theatre. I have been participating in more than ten productions in various theatre groups, starting in 2003. I was also doing improvisation theatre in a group for one year. And I was director for the first time, the play was [An ideal Husband](http://dramateure.ch/wordpress/produktionen/ein-idealer-gatte/) by Oscar Wilde. 

Another hobby is photography. I am taking pictures of nature, people, and architecture sujets with my digital camera (Nikon D800) and a steadily increasing collection of lenses. 

And lastly I enjoy literature and writing. I don't have the patience and time for bigger works, but this weblog with it's short articles is just perfect for me.
