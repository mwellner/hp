When rethinking the way blog links were assigned to languages, my first thought was to use flag symbols, as e.g. in Ulli&#8217;s blog. But I surfed a little bit around and found a good site arguing against that. Here is the [link to the main page](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/) covering many topics in web authoring and communication technology. The ones I scanned I found very interesting to read.

Some of the covered topics:

  * [Why you should not use a flag as a symbol of a language](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/flags.html)
  * [A tutorial on character code issues](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/chars.html)
  * [English &#8211; the universal language of the web?](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/lingua-franca.html)
  * [Web authoring and surfing](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/www.html)
