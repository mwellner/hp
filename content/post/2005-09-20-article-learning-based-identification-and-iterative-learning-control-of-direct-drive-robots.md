The article (see [bibliographic information](http://www.citeulike.org/user/wellnair/article/316133)) fits very much in what I am planning to do with the Lokomat. It is very well done in my opinion and a good base for my work. A robot with three degrees of freedom is used to investigate the proposed identification and control methods.

> Abstractâ€”A combination of model-based and iterative learning
  
> control (ILC) is proposed as a method to achieve high-quality motion
  
> control of direct-drive robots in repetitive motion tasks.We include
  
> both model-based and learning components in the total control
  
> law, as their individual properties influence the performance
  
> of motion control. The model-based part of the controller compensates
  
> much of the nonlinear and coupled robot dynamics. A new
  
> procedure for estimating the parameters of the rigid body model,
  
> implemented in this part of the controller, is used. This procedure
  
> is based on a batch-adaptive control algorithm that estimates the
  
> model parameters online. Information about the dynamics not covered
  
> by the rigid body model, due to flexibilities, is acquired experimentally,
  
> by identification. The models of the flexibilities are used
  
> in the design of the iterative learning controllers for the individual
  
> joints. Use of the models facilitates quantitative prediction of performance
  
> improvement via ILC. The effectiveness of the combination
  
> of the model-based and the iterative learning controllers is
  
> demonstrated in experiments on a spatial serial direct-drive robot
  
> with revolute joints.
