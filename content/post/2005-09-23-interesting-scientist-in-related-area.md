My problem is still to find a suitable method for implementing cooperative control strategies possibly without using reference trajectories. One paper I found on that is **A Minimal Intervention Principle for Coordinated Movement** by Emanual Todorov and Michael I. Jordan.

The [Homepage of Mr. Emanuel Todorov](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/) is quiet interesting, he publishes there all his articles. I will spend some time on studying that since his approach (optimal stochastical control) seems promising for me.
