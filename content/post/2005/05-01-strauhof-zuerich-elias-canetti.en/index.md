Today, so I was determined to, something cultural was on my way. After a short look into local exhibitions I decided to give Elias Canetti (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Canetti">Wikipedia entry</a>) a chance, whose name I had never heard before. Moreover the exhibition is going to end May 29th, what is a further reason to pay that exhibition a visit.

Elias Canetti was born 1905 and lived in many places, but for a quiet long time also in Zurich. I was a little bit disappointed that he never lived in Dresden, but at least he spent three months in Berlin. He studied Chemistry in Wien but soon switched to become a professional writer. Maybe this took him to me, the scientific background connected to his later profession of writing.

His main work is <b>Crowds and Power</b>, he reflected the occurrance of crowd phenomenons, e.&thinsp;g. people on strike, street fights, sport spectators. He compared some of these cases with fire, erupting abruptly, gaining ground and extinguishing. I found that idea compelling and I read some paragraphs of the book. It was well written and structured, maybe I will read it entirely later.
