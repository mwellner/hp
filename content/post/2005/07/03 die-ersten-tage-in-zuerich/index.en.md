I have arrived. The move worked fine, thanks to many nice people that helped me with it. Most of all my father who drove the whole distance together with me, returning by plane the next morning. Many hands helped loading and unloading, it was just awesome.

My flat is located in Witikon, whar is a quarter a little bit off the centre of Zurich. It&#8217;s an area where many paople live and have their houses, many churches are there as well. From my window I see one of them (catholic) directly. The quarter lies at the bank of the Zurich Sea, from my window I see a small part of that marvellous water. Besides I am looking on the other bank of the sea, that is covered by trees.
