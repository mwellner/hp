Today I used that magnificent day to explore Zurich by foot. I walked along the Limmat to the main station and from there to nearby Üetliberg. The slopes of that hill are grown with trees, carefully installed trails lead through a hill park. Actually there aren&#8217;t that many ways up. But for some reason I managed to loose my way and find myself back at the bottom of the hill.
