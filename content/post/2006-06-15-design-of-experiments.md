What is the best way to set up an experiment? 

Although this question sems easy at first sight, it is not. Especially for engineers, since we are tought to solve problems, not to investigate a hypothesis with an experiment. There is even a whole bunch of knowledge existing on that, see [Wikipedia: Design of Experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments). So I have an entry point and can reconsider my intuitive setup for investigating multimodal feedback in obstacle crossing.
