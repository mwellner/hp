Do you work most of your time at the computer? Then [Workrave](http://www.workrave.org) may be a good choice for you. It is designed to enforce smaller and larger breaks while you are working on your computer. The goal is to prevent repetitive strain injury (see [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury)), which can result from too much work in the same position. It also helps to give your eyes a rest from time to time. The program is _open source_ and available for the platforms Linux and Windows.
