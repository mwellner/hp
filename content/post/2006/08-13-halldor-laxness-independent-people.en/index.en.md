After travellinging around Iceland in ten days in July 2006 I also wanted to explore its literature. So I decided to read the most famous Icelandic author, 1955 Nobel Price for Literature winner Halldór Laxness ([see Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halld%C3%B3r_Laxness)). Many novels were standing in that Reykjavik bookshop, with full rows in the bookshelf of English and German translations. I chose [Independent People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_People) as a start, the story of a shepherd, struggling for independence, sacrificing even some family members for that dream.

I see some similarities to Ibsens "Brand", although the main characters are quite different.
