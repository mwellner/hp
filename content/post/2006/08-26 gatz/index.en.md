It's his voice. He reads the book ([The Great Gatsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gatsby), written by [F. Scott Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald)), gets absorbed in it. This American voice, I somehow can still hear it. He carries the play, which lasts altogether over 6 hours. I just saw the first half of it. He reads it all, every single word in it.

I know the book. I read it earlier this year and enjoyed the style. That is probably the main reason why I chose to give this quite long play a chance. I could not motivate anybody to come with me, it seems a little bit too special.

This combination of reading and play is absolutely unique. I could not imagine a better way to do it. It never got boring, people entered the stage and went off, music playing, a wild party illustrated vividly and the characters just fitted. The group [Elevator Repair Service](https://www.elevator.org/) is from New York and is one of the numberous attractions of the [Theaterspektakel](https://www.theaterspektakel.ch/) in Zurich. Odd to mention, they were not allowed to play in New York, because another adaptation (2.5h, more like a musical) got the exclusive licence.

After my first, more disappointing visit of a modern theatre piece at the _Theaterspektakel_ this one really was just great. I am looking forward to part two which will follow tomorrow afternoon.
