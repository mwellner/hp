After spending weeks with scanning my Spain negatives I am taking aim to get a digital camera. The internet us full of technical advice, but reading some articles on [this site](http://www.kenrockwell.com) really put things in perspective. In the end the equipment you use is secondary, your eye and imagination do matter far more. So I don&#8217;t need to read endless tests and dig into specifications, I will just get one of those new neat cameras and focus on making nice photographs. 

I would like to point out two nice articles of the mentioned website, since they emphasize this very much:

  * [The Seven Levels of Photographers](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/7.htm)
  * [Your Camera Does Not Matter](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamera.htm)

Although I liked very much his articles on why the camera doesn&#8217;t matter and such, I must say that his pictures did not impress me much. Nice holiday shots but nothing that is really special. But maybe he just has a different style, one that is more quite and not so pathetic as mine is compared to that.
