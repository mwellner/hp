One basic aspect of time-management is setting goals. This is essential as witout goals you can&#8217;t focus. If you happe to attend a time-management seminar you will be confronted with such things as SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Reailistic, Time-bound). However, in [this entry from Steve Pavlina&#8217;s Weblog](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/08/how-to-set-goals-you-will-actually-achieve/) a different approach is taken. Goal setting is seen as bringing effects for the present moment, not for one day in future when you will have achieved this goal. That&#8217;s a huge difference and much better, since with the other concept you hunt for a moment that will never arrive. And if it has arrived, new goals appear to be achieved, so you actually are never at this state of having achieved what you like. It&#8217;s like catching your shadow.
