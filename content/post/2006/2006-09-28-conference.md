I am in! After sending an abstract to the conference [Medicine Meets Virtual Reality](http://www.nextmed.com/) about the Lokomat and virtual reality (obstacle crossing), I now received the message, that it was accepted for poster presentation. And so my name appears once more in the www, on the Abstract Guidelines page. It&#8217;s there, at the very, very end of this long list.
