It&#8217;s day 2 of the conference now, my interactive presentation was already on the first day. Some people were really interested and so this time passed away quickly. The presentations are &#8211; as to be expected at a conference of such dimensions &#8211; diverse in their contents and presentation level.

_Conference venue: the palace hotel in Nordwijk, The Netherlands_

The highlight so far was a trip to Delft University yesterday. We had a lab visit there and saw some very interesting robotic projects. Some images for your entertainment&#8230;
