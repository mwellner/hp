As a threatening example, I would like you to read the following abstract. It consists of only two sentences. Five or six would have been better.

> Causal interactive audio and visual feedback sourced from whatever faculty is available from children with severe disability and utilised within an adaptable user-friendly interactive environment that encourages, motivates, and is “fun” to participate within has proved to be a rich resource within which to research towards possibilities for the children to reach their fullest potential. This paper details the practical implementation of further (related to earlier work) various visual media; virtual reality; and associated technologies so as to further enhance the study and to verify the feasibility towards a commercial system product.
