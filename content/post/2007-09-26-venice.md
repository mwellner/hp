Greetings from one of the most beautiful cities in the world!

I arrived today, one day before conference start. My stay here had a bad start, as it was raining heavily, I had lost my umbrella in Montpellier and got really wet, the conference is taking place on Lido island, one of the less interesting islands in the Venice area, and my expensive hotel is only serving breakfast. But after 2 PM everything turned well as the weather improved significantly, I used fast bus and boat connections to escape Lido, strolled around around Piazza San Marco, and visited the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. So I satisfied my curiosity for Venice and look forward to the conference and my free sunday.
