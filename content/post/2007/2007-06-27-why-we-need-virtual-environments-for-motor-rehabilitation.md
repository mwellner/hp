I recently stumbled over the publication [T. Mulder: A Process-Oriented Model of Human Motor Behavior: Toward a Theory-Based Rehabilitation Approach](http://www.citeulike.org/user/wellnair/article/1416712). Looking for an underlying red line in the introduction of a planned publication by me, the article fitted extremely well in motivating the usage of virtual environments and other advanced techniques for gait rehabilitation.

It is based on an integrated model of human motor performance, what I also found in [Motor Learning and Performance](http://www.citeulike.org/user/wellnair/article/480365). From this very recent model of motor learning and performance, he formulates &#8220;three crucial requirements&#8221; for motor rehabilitation, namely

  1. avalability of adequate feedback and knowledge of result,
  2. variability of practice, and
  3. adequate design of the learning situation.

Later on he recommends a &#8220;learning landscape, in which relevant aspects of the environment can be simulated and implemented into the therapy&#8221;. For me, virtual environments are a very good approach to implement a varying training landscape.
