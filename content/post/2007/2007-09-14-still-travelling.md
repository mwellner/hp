Today we arrived at the most Western point of our trip, at Beziers. We visit a friend of Mario and will spend some time with Sarah and her family during the weekend. After that we will head back in Eastern direction towards Nice, where our trip started a few days ago.

So far the highlight was canoeingÂ on the Ardeche river, we took a mall trip with lots of torrents and got some water in the boat as well ðŸ™‚ We also explored the beautiful French cities Nice, Aix-en-Provence, and Avignon.
