The positive impact of virtual environments for patients is discussed in a recent [washingtonpost.com article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100502391.html).

I happen to know one of the experts who is mentioned there, Albert &#8220;Skip&#8221; Rizzo, just met him in Venice at the conference Virtual Rehabilitation 2007. He presented some results of his Virtual Iraq project, aiming to treat returning soldiers with Combat-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
