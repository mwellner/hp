_Beyond the fog_

One of the most popular hiking mountains in Switzerland is the Säntis (~2500m). It is not too difficult to get there, for the lazy sunday folks there is even a cablecar going directly to the top of the mountain. We chose a different approach. From Wasserauen we went up by cablecar to get beyond the fog. After that we took a nice five hour hike to the Säntis top. Many people were out there, which came to no surprise on such a beautiful sunday.
