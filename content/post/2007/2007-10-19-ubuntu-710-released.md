The new version of [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) has been released. I have been using ubuntu for some years now and I am still a big fan of it. The developers have now implemented 3D desktop effects, which you probably know from Apple. But this is only one of many improved features of this Linux distribution. What I like most about Linux is the way to edit and process LaTeX documents, the constant and automatic updates of all software, and that it&#8217;s free. On my wish list would be using Photoshop with Linux, but surely Adobe is to blame for that.

Amendment: I could upgrade easily on my IBM T40p laptop, but faced some problems on my desktop computer. The problem was due to the ATI Radeon 9600 graphics card. After activating a proprietary driver for it, I could not use the advanced desktop effects. Deactivating the driver fixed the problem, now I can enjoy all these fancy, eye candy effects. I could find some useful hints on setting up and configuring compiz (the new window manager responsible for the effects) at Forlong&#8217;s Blog. Now, everything rotates and looks transparent, my desktop burns, changing the application is a real event and my four desktops change with a nice cube effect.
