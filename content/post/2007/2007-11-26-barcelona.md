I spent the last three days in Barcelona, Spain. The primary reason was to visit the institute of [Mel Slater](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Slater/), who agreed to be an external advisor for my PhD thesis. On Friday I gave a short overview of my research in front of the institute and discussed several open questions. After that I had two days left to see the city. I will post more photos in the next days on flickr, the one below should be more like a precursor.
