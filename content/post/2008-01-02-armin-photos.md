In late December last year, a colleague of mine wanted to take some photos of his arm rehabilitation robot, which he called ARMin. It was his last official week, since he finished his PhD and is now spending some time in Davos for non-scientific purposes. He asked me for my camera and I also took some of the more artistic and symbolic shots within the session.

_Motion blur is a must for a robotic device like this, so I asked Marco to freeze everything except for his arm. The exposure time was 0.625s._

_This is a more symbolic shot for the concept of robotic therapy, showing the helping hands of Patrizia while she is fixing Marco in the robot._
