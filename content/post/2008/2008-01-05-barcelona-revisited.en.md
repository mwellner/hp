As [stated earlier](http://www.mwellner.de/2007/11/26/barcelona/), I spent three days in Barcelona last November. After a somewhat busy December, I now begin to rediscover the photos I took in these days. The main attraction for me were the buildings of [Antonio Gaudi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudi), the well-known Spanish architect. And amongst these buildings, the [Sagrada Familia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia) is probably most popular, despite of or due to being unfinished to this day.

But even more impressive than the unfinished church are some stone works in front of the building. They seem to have grown out of the stone.

What striked me most with all these buildings of Gaudi was that feeling of ease, created by his organic shapes, requiring very hard calculations on the engineering side of construction. It's easy to draw a curved roof on a piece of paper, but much harder to do the calculations and to convince the construction people to trust in the stability of your imaginative creations. 

I will put some more pictures on [my flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mwellner) in the next days, so keep your eyes open. In case you use a RSS feed aggregator, you can also subscribe to my [flickr photos](http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=26678038@N00&lang=en-us&format=rss_200) or to [this weblog](http://www.mwellner.de/feed/).
