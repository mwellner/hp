Finally, we got it through! I now can also reveal that the scientific journal of my choice was [Presence](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/pres), published by MIT Press. It was a long process, which raised my awareness of scientific language enormously. However, I am not sure whether that is a good thing. I now tend to get on other people&#8217;s nerves when they write something and ask for my opinion on that. There are so many mistakes and inconsistencies to discover.

I wonder if there is one written form to express an idea adequately. One form which has exactly the right length. And I wonder, how many iterations it takes to get to that form.
