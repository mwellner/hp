A new version of my favorite Linux distribution [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) has been released. I can really recommend it, with the single exception of photo editing and desktop publishing ([Adobe Creative Suite CS3](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/creativesuite/) is hard to beat in that). But apart from that, you can browse the web with the new [Mozilla Firefox 3](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html), manage your emails, appointments and tasks with Evolution, create documents, spread sheets and presentations with [Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org/) and all that for free with automatic upgrading on the operating system level.
