#### Architecture and Arts in Bilbao

Cities, always cities. Small and moony, huge and loud, modern and artistic, there are many combinations and Northern Spain certainly has to offer a number of beautiful cities. Metropolitan hubs Madrid and Barcelona are more to the South, Bilbao is the biggest city in this region. And because of the airport it also became the start and destination point of our tour. The dull industrial city is mainly known for the [Guggenheim Museum Bilbao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guggenheim_Museum_Bilbao), which was built 1997.

It truly is a masterpiece of modern architecture. There are no straight lines on this building, every few steps a new perspective is unfolding. And there is also a lot to discover in the inside. In the basic level, video and other installations are waiting for the visitors. Richard Serra created a number of huge steel constructions, which were walkable. The walls were inclining in different directions when you made your way to the centre or exit. But I was not really impressed by this. Far more interesting were the paintings from the early 20th century. One Chagall was hanging there, some small Picassos, and &#8212; my personal favourite &#8212; _The Yellow Cow_ by [Franz Marc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Marc). 

#### El Bierzo

If you like to hike far from the beaten track, I can recommend this region. It&#8217;s North-West of the city of Leon. We stayed in the small city _Vega de Espinareda_ for a few days. In the local tourism office we got three self-made hiking maps for hikes in the region. The maps were more like treasure maps but sufficient to find the way.

The longest tour started in the contemplative village of Burbia. We parked our car in the village and started hiking, guided by our treasure map. Still being in the village, two small dogs were joining us on the tour. Our destination were some lakes on a high plateau, there were even some signposts along the way. But compared to Swiss standards these signposts were rather isolated and you had to decide on your own a couple of times. As a rule of thump &#8212; don&#8217;t make a turn until you are really sure.

The second hike started at the pass _Puerto des Ancares_ at 1648&thinsp;m. The clouds were hovering over us, passing from North to South. But we were lucky with the weather, there was no rain on this day.

#### Picos de Europa

But our real goal for hiking was the National Park [Picos de Europa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picos_de_Europa), we even had gotten a guide with 50 hiking suggestions. Our brave ride from rainy [Galicia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_%28Spain%29) to the Picos was rewarded with beautiful hiking weather. Already from the camp site we could see the Central Massif.

The three day hikes in the Picos fulfilled all our expectations, they were varied, tough, some even had alpine character. Our highest point was a small hut at about 2300&thinsp;m. On our way back to the cablecar, some goats came in our way.
