You probably will think I am strange. Or you may feel confirmed in that opinion, if you thought that already. But I really try to read this book. Enjoying these last weeks before I will start working in Zurich, I want to do something meaningful, enhancing my horizon. And thus, I decided to read that book. To give you a short impression, I will quote one part of the sencond chapter, which sounds quite meaningful.

{{<blockquote>}}
&ndash; History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.<br>
From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal. What if the nightmare gave you a back kick? <br>
&ndash; The ways of the creator are not our ways, Mr. Deasy said. All history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.<br>
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:<br>
&ndash; That is God.<br>
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!<br>
&ndash; What? Mr. Deasy asked. 
&ndash; A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
