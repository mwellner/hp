Waiting.
  
Waiting for Kafka.
  
Waiting for Godot.

Writing.
  
Writing to pass the time.
  
Writing about Kafka.

20 minutes to pass.
  
20 lines with 20 letters.
  
Maybe more. Maybe less.

I am waiting.
  
Kafka is waiting.
  
Waiting.
  
Just waiting.
  
Spending time.
  
People pass.

Patience.
  
I have time.
  
Although time is nothing to have or not have. 
  
You don&#8217;t have time.
  
You spend time.
  
But spending also implies possession.
  
Time spends you.
  
Time passes.
  
Time doesn&#8217;t care for you at all.
  
Time.
