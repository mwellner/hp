It's day 2 of the conference now, my interactive presentation was already on the first day. Some people were really interested and so this time passed away quickly. The presentations are -- as to be expected at a conference of such dimensions -- diverse in their contents and presentation level. The highlight so far was a trip to Delft University yesterday. We had a lab visit there and saw some very interesting robotic projects.
