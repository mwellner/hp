I changed again the underlying technical structure of my weblog. Why? In my old weblog (based on serendipity), comments were no longer possible due to trackback spammers. So I changed to this new weblog service, which is offered by ETH Zurich. Comments are possible (after solving a math task to prevent automatic insertion of comment spam) and I will also profit from the high Google rank of the ethz.ch domain.

Another advantage is that I can easily add podcasts, meaning audio files to my weblog. You will see a small symbol underneath which plays the sound. It can't be easier! So I will try to provide some podcasts and hope for positive reactions.
