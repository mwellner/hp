One highlight of the ICORR 2007 was the dance performance with three wheelchair and one healthy dancer. The contrast between these different styles of movement, the different interactions possible, the usage of space -- all this was very special for the performance, which was organized by [Rock en Rolstoel](http://www.rockenrolstoel.nl/).
