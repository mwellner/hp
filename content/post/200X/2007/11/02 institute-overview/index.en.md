In the past days I've spent some hours with Illustrator to create an overview image of our research activities. The result is now on our [group homepage](http://www.sms.hest.ethz.ch/), I used opacity masks extensively.

What you basically do is to draw a rectangle and apply a gradient filling (either linear or radial). You then move this rectangle over your image and select &#8220;Make Opacity Mask&#8221; from the &#8220;Transparency&#8221; toolbox, which is one of the sliders below the color swatches. The two objects are combined and you get a nice transparency gradient. I used linear gradients for blending the single images and a radial gradient to create the overall shape. One trick to overlay multiple linear gradients is to select another blending mode. The &#8220;Normal&#8221; blending mode means that the object in front covers all other objects. Select &#8220;Multiply&#8221; to overlay multiple masks (same &#8220;Transparency&#8221; toolbox as used before).
