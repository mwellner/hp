After a little bit more than four years of research, this day saw my doctoral examination. It certainly wasn&#8217;t my best presentation, but I made it through and passed the exam. My presentation lasted about 40&thinsp;minutes, the questions and answers another 20&thinsp;minutes. After one hour we were all asked to leave the room and only the professors remained in there to discuss my fate. After an endless time of fifteen minutes, I was called in the room and notified of the successful outcome. So it&#8217;s over now. I feel relieved and very glad. I feel thankful towards the many people who supported me in this time, many of them were present at my defence talk.

In July 2005 I started on this journey, leaving behind Dresden and everything I knew. My research started with cooperative control strategies and the Lokomat, went on to virtual environments for gait rehabilitation, and finally brought me to the M<sup>3</sup> Rowing Simulator. I covered quite some topics with rehabilitation robotics, virtual environments for rehabilitation, and sports simulation. I designed experiments, used Matlab and Simulink with high proficiency, programmed a lot in C++ and C#, used statistical methods, and supervised quite some students. Four years, which were characterised by learning and slow advance.

**Edit:** I am not officially a "Dr. sc." yet. This will be in October, after two ETH committees have approved and after I have handed in the printed and electronic versions for the library.
