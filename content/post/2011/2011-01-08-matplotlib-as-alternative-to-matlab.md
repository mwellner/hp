Back in the old ETH days, I got used to [Matlab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlab), which we used for a variety of tasks, among them data analysis, figure creation and even real-time control. For the task of figure plotting I have recently discovered [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) &ndash; an open source alternative, which can be used by python scripts. The plotting functions sound very familiar for Matlab users. So I am again amazed by the progress of open source software. 

For my current project that deals with testing tools (doing functional and repetitive tests) I will probably make use of the matplotlib functionality to provide some output graphs after tests.
