Sweating once a day keeps the doctor away &ndash; today I succeeded. After five kilometers in the Irchelpark I am lying on the ground and melt away. I am getting into running, the track today was not so difficult. I started it slowly on the first round, keeping an eye on my heart rate. I did some tempo variations in the second round, a training tip to get out of the monotony of running the same rounds at the same speed ever and ever again, which also triggers different types of muscles. After that I had found my speed of around 10&thinsp;km/h and kept it for the remaining distance.

The good thing about running is, that it means very low effort. Just dress, get on the sneakers and off you go. I just need to go past the street to enter Irchelpark and its running track.
