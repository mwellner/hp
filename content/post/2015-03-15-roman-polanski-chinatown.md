<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_%281974_film%29" title="Chinatown (film)" target="_blank">Chinatown</a> is widely regarded as classic and surely one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski" title="Roman Polanski" target="_blank">Polanskis</a> master pieces. It follows the film noir tradition, set in a drying and sun-flooded Los Angeles. The main character (the young Jack Nicholson), a private detective, is investigating the murder of the city&#8217;s chief water engineer. He is drawn in a jungle of corruption.
