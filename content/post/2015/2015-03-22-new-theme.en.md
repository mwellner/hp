I have changed the appearance of my web site, giving the <a href="http://www.cryoutcreations.eu/nirvana" title="Nirvana WordPress Theme" target="_blank">Nirvana WordPress theme</a> a chance. My goal was to get away from <a href="http://www.cryoutcreations.eu/parabola/" title="Parabola WordPress Theme" target="_blank">Parabola</a>, since we use that on <a href="http://dramateure.ch" title="die dramateure zÃ¼rich" target="_blank">dramateure.ch</a> as well. The elements are roughly the same, but the look is slightly different. 

One thing I noted with great delight &ndash; you can use the <a href="http://lesscss.org/" title="Less CSS" target="_blank">Less pre-processor</a> when typing in your custom CSS. What I actually changed were table styles, they had defined quite large paddings, making my acting overview page look strange. 

What I also changed was the default font. After hearing Erik Spiekermann on <a href="http://2015.uxmunich.com/" title="UX Munich" target="_blank">UX Munich</a>, I am now giving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fira_Sans" title="Fira Sans" target="_blank">Fira Sans</a> a try. It was developed to look good on screen and hand-held devices.
