> I don&#8217;t know how to write love. I try to write it properly, and it just comes out embarrassing. 

Apart from relationships, literature is a major topic, and how to write _the real thing_. But Henry fails to write a love theatre play for Annie, expressing his unability to write about love. 

> I can deal with idiots, and I can deal with sensible argument, but I don’t know how to deal with you. 

This quote introduces the cricket monologue, which is Henrys final attempt to make his point about good plays and bad plays. 

> Without you I wouldn&#8217;t care. I&#8217;d eat tinned spaghetti and put on yesterday&#8217;s clothes. 

Stoppards attempt to write about love is funny and remarkable. Unfortunately, the second sentence was removed from our version of the play. 

If you are curious about the play and want to see it, go to <a href="http://dramateure.ch" title="die dramateure zürich" target="_blank">dramateure.ch</a> and reserve your tickets now.
