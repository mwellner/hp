It has been a year now since I have entered the ranks of <a href="http://www.comparis.ch" title="comparis.ch" target="_blank">comparis.ch</a>. The major new technology for me to learn in this time has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" title="Wikipedia - JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>.

I have recently stumbled upon this talk given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford" title="Wikipedia - Douglas Crockford" target="_blank">Douglas Crockford</a>, author of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do" title="JavaScript - The Good Parts" target="_blank">JavaScript &#8211; The Good Parts</a> and creator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" title="Wikipedia - JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a>. What I like most of all is his self-ironic attitude.
