One of the main problems of software development is managing complexity and &ndash; related to it &ndash; decoupling pieces of code. While most programming languages provide built-in semantics for defining and consuming modules, JavaScript has none and relies on external libraries for that.

There are three major approaches for defining modules in JavaScript:

  * CommonJS
  * Asynchronous Module Definition
  * ECMA 6 Syntax

I have found some good articles on the topic. 

  * [Writing Modular JavaScript With AMD, CommonJS & ES Harmony](http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/) by Addy Osmani
  * [ECMAScript 6 modules: the future is now](http://www.2ality.com/2013/07/es6-modules.html) by Axel Rauschmayer

JavaScript modularity will be the main topic for an internal, upcoming project, so I will dive in the topic in the upcoming weeks.
