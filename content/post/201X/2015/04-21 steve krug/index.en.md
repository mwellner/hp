In the field of user experience (UX), the book written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Krug" title="Steve Krug" target="_blank">Steve Krug</a> is considered a classic. It is not too long, following his own principles of brevity and clarity in content presentation. I am reading this, because I experience UX discussions at work (<a href="http://comparis.ch" title="comparis.ch" target="_blank">comparis.ch</a>) quite often. 

Krug starts with a chapter on how people actually perceive and work with web pages. Instead of carefully reading and deliberately choosing the right option, people behave completely different. Krug outlines these findings as

  1. We don't read pages. We scan them.
  2. We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.
  3. We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.

With these findings in mind, he gives recommendations on how to design web sites as _billboards_. Most is common sense, but he has a very good way of explaning and presenting it. 

**Krug&#8217;s Laws of Usability**

  1. Don&#8217;t make me think.
  2. It doesn&#8217;t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.
  3. Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what&#8217;s left.
