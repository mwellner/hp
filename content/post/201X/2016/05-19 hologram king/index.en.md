One pleasurable cinematic experience was the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hologram_for_the_King_%28film%29" title="A Hologram for the King" target="_blank">A Hologram for the King</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Tykwer" title="Tom Tykwer" target="_blank">Tom Tykwer</a>. Tom Hanks stars as an ageing sales agent, who is sent to Saudi Arabia for a pitch of a virtual reality conference system. He finds himself with his fellow colleages in a tent in the desert, the king far away and probably never coming. I really enjoyed watching it and can recommend it.
