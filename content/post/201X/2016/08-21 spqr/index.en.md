I have started to read a new book, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/18/spqr-by-mary-beard-review-rome" title="SPQR: A History Of Ancient Rome" target="_blank">SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome</a> 
by Mary Beard. She takes quite a good approach and starts at 63 BC with Cicero accusing 
Catiline of conspiring against Rome (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Catilinarian_conspiracy" title="Second Catilinarian conspiracy" target="_blank">Second Catiline conspiracy</a>), in one of the most popular political speeches.

How long, Catiline, will you abuse our patience?<br>

After this introduction, the next chapter goes back to the beginnings of Rome as a 
little village. It is a good read and surely to recommend for those interested in history.
