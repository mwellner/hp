  <p>This poem was sent to me by my sister, who is right now in Alabama in the United States. There was an additional text saying it was created by a young cancer patient and that every email sent with this poem would result in a donation. Knowing many hoaxes (see <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa022599.htm">hoax message on this special message</a>, it was written by someone else) playing with the empathy of people I do not believe in this but I still found the poem nice. It just fitted since I spent the last days programming a robot shooting balls and defending, not having much time for anything else. So actually right now is the moment for me to <em>slow down</em>&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SLOW DANCE</p>

<p>Have you ever watched kids</p>

<p>On a merry-go-round?</p>

<p>Or listened to the rain</p>

<p>Slapping on the ground?</p>

<p>Ever followed a butterfly&#8217;s erratic flight?</p>

<p>Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?</p>

<p>You better slow down.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t dance so fast.</p>

<p>Time is short.</p>

<p>The music won&#8217;t last.</p>

<p>Do you run through each day</p>

<p>On the fly?</p>

<p>When you ask How are you</p>

<p>Do you hear the reply?</p>

<p>When the day is done</p>

<p>Do you lie in your bed</p>

<p>With the next hundred chores</p>

<p>Running through your head?</p>

<p>You&#8217;d better slow down</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t dance so fast.</p>

<p>Time is short.</p>

<p>The music won&#8217;t last.</p>

<p>Ever told your child,</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll do it tomorrow?</p>

<p>And in your haste,</p>

<p>Not see his sorrow?</p>

<p>Ever lost touch,</p>

<p>Let a good friendship die</p>

<p>Cause you never had time</p>

<p>To call and say, &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;</p>

<p>You&#8217;d better slow down.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t dance so fast.</p>

<p>Time is short.</p>

<p>The music won&#8217;t last.</p>

<p>When you run so fast to get somewhere</p>

<p>You miss half the fun of getting there.</p>

<p>When you worry and hurry through your day,</p>

<p>It is like an unopened gift&#8230;.</p>

<p>Thrown away.</p>

<p>Life is not a race.</p>

<p>Do take it slower</p>

<p>Hear the music</p>

<p>Before the song is over.</p>
</blockquote>
