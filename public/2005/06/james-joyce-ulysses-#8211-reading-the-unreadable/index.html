  <p>You probably will think I am strange. Or you may feel confirmed in that opinion, if you thought that already. But I really try to read this book. Enjoying these last weeks before I will start working in Zurich, I want to do something meaningful, enhancing my horizon. And thus, I decided to read that book. To give you a short impression, I will quote one part of the sencond chapter, which sounds quite meaningful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>_</p>

<p>&#8211; History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.</p>

<p>From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal. What if the nightmare gave you a back kick?</p>

<p>&#8211; The ways of the creator are not our ways, Mr. Deasy said. All history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.</p>

<p>Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:</p>

<p>&#8211; That is God.</p>

<p>Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!</p>

<p>&#8211; What? Mr. Deasy asked.</p>

<p>&#8211; A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>_</p>
</blockquote>
