  <p>The article (see <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/user/wellnair/article/316133">bibliographic information</a>) fits very much in what I am planning to do with the Lokomat. It is very well done in my opinion and a good base for my work. A robot with three degrees of freedom is used to investigate the proposed identification and control methods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract—A combination of model-based and iterative learning</p>

<p>control (ILC) is proposed as a method to achieve high-quality motion</p>

<p>control of direct-drive robots in repetitive motion tasks.We include</p>

<p>both model-based and learning components in the total control</p>

<p>law, as their individual properties influence the performance</p>

<p>of motion control. The model-based part of the controller compensates</p>

<p>much of the nonlinear and coupled robot dynamics. A new</p>

<p>procedure for estimating the parameters of the rigid body model,</p>

<p>implemented in this part of the controller, is used. This procedure</p>

<p>is based on a batch-adaptive control algorithm that estimates the</p>

<p>model parameters online. Information about the dynamics not covered</p>

<p>by the rigid body model, due to flexibilities, is acquired experimentally,</p>

<p>by identification. The models of the flexibilities are used</p>

<p>in the design of the iterative learning controllers for the individual</p>

<p>joints. Use of the models facilitates quantitative prediction of performance</p>

<p>improvement via ILC. The effectiveness of the combination</p>

<p>of the model-based and the iterative learning controllers is</p>

<p>demonstrated in experiments on a spatial serial direct-drive robot</p>

<p>with revolute joints.</p>
