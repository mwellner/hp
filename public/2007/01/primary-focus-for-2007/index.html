  <p>The change of years always holds the chance to review the old year and set a new focus for the new one. I think it really makes sence to set one primary focus a year, to devote time for it and &#8211; hopefully &#8211; make some progress there. This was inspired by Steve Pavlinas article <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/12/setting-your-primary-focus/">Setting Your Primary Focus</a>, although I did some kind of goal setting already for years.</p>

<p>In 2007, my primary focus will be my physical shape. It&#8217;s not that I am completely out of it, but I just realized that I was tending to sleep longer and having less energy throughout last year, especially in winter. So I hope to exercise more regularly and put other things behind if necessary.</p>
