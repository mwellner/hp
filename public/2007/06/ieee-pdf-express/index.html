  <p>In the past I very often had the impression that most of my friends believe I have an easy life as scientist. And I must admit, most things are cool being a PhD student here in Zurich. But some aren&#8217;t. And one of the most detestable ordeals on my way to scientific achievement is the IEEE pdf express tool. Because you need to get past that to submit a paper for the conference proceedings.</p>

<p>Imagine you spent weeks and months on something like a optimization or extensive study of a new virtual environment feedback strategy. You worked out all the problems, cheered up your despaired students, tracked down cryptic C++ Compiler errors, spent night after night in the lab to just solve that <em>last</em> problem, kept your boss informed and amused, and finally you have got the graphs and all the knowledge that you want to share with the scientific world. So you select a nice conference (in our field the most important conferences are sponsored by <a href="http://www.ieee.org">IEEE</a>), and write down your dearly bought knowledge. You even used a template to rule out your inadequate wisdom on the fonts, sizes, margins, and such things. And this is what <em>pdf express</em> sends to you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mathias Wellner,</p>

<p>The following PDF has failed the PDF Check:</p>

<p>Filename: Filename.pdf</p>

<p>Title: Great Results in Rehabilitation Robotics</p>

<p>Paper ID: 4491</p>

<p>Please see the attached report for a list of the specific problem areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And these are the problems, that the report revealed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Document contains Link annotation(s)</li>
<li>Bookmarks found in document</li>
<li>Document structure is compressed</li>
<li>Font TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT is not embedded (25x)</li>
<li>Font TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT is not embedded (76x)</li>
<li>Font TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT is not embedded</li>
<li>Font ArialMT is not embedded (35x)</li>
<li>Font Arial-ItalicMT is not embedded (4x)</li>
<li>Font Helvetica is not embedded (28x)</li>
</ul>

<p>And the worst thing is, I was not even aware, that I have <em>links</em> in this Word document, let alone <em>bookmarks</em>. Is this HTML or a web browser? And all this font embedding crap. I told Distiller to <strong>embed all fonts</strong>. Really all of them, so why doen&#8217;t it just listen to me? And in these moments I feel absolutely powerless and insignificant.</p>

<p>Trust me &#8211; being a PhD student is not easy!</p>

<p>Note: I finally found a way to get rid of those error messages. Instead of Word, I used IEEEs LaTeX template and created a PDF that passed this test. Yet, embedding fonts still proved problematic, as fonts of included eps figures were not embedded. I used ps2pdf with the option <em>prepress</em> to get what I wanted. And now it is all neatly integrated in my Makefile.</p>
