<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper describes evaluation experiments for visual, acoustic, and haptic</p>

<p>feedback in a virtual obstacle walking scenario applied to gait rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Multiple studies with healthy subjects were carried out using the actuated gait</p>

<p>orthosis Lokomat. Controlled factors for the visual feedback experiment were three</p>

<p>different perspectives and 2D/3D vision. In the acoustic feedback experiment,</p>

<p>controlled factors were rhythmic distance feedback and gradual foot clearance</p>

<p>feedback. For visual and acoustic feedback experiments, outcome was assessed with</p>

<p>task-specific performance parameters and questionnaires. Haptic feedback consisted</p>

<p>of penalty, impulsive, and friction force components and was evaluated using</p>

<p>parameters related to hardness and occurrence of vibrations. Results for visual</p>

<p>feedback indicate that the chosen side perspective is superior to behind and ego</p>

<p>perspectives. It is also shown that 3D vision does not reduce the number of obstacle</p>

<p>hits compared to 2D vision. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the addition of</p>

<p>continuous acoustic feedback makes subjects walk faster compared to the exclusive</p>

<p>use of visual feedback. The results for haptic feedback indicate that the addition of</p>

<p>impulsive and friction force components leads to harder surfaces and less vibrations.</p>

<p>The main contribution of this paper is the evaluation of multimodal feedback and</p>

<p>consequential optimization of an obstacle scenario for gait rehabilitation.</p>
