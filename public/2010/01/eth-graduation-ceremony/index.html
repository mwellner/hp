  <p>The last chapter, the very last on my way to PhD &ndash; the ceremonial handover of the certificate. The Scherrer lecture hall was decorated festively, as were the new doctors. The ETH Big Band performed with a brassy ensemble, blaring jubilation. Every one of us then would walk there, receiving the certificate from the rector. A few words, smiling towards the photographer, again to the rector, &#8220;all the best on your way&#8221;. The same procedure for about 150 persons, non-stop certificates. Believe me, it&#8217;s nothing special. I had to return to my company in the evening, finishing something, caught in my new job.</p>

<p>Slowly my view on the ETH time is becoming transfigured, another station passed. But from here the next step is unclear, I am completely free. Enterprise, projects, family, Germany, Switzerland, Austria &ndash; it&#8217;s all open.</p>

<p>The certificate is well-designed. The ETH logo is embossed, fine red lines draw through the area on the right; and the slim ETH font gives the title area an austere elegance. I will keep it safe and not put it on my wall, because I don&#8217;t want people to consult me for physical ailments.</p>
