  <p>Three days in Andeer and vicinity &ndash; time for relaxation, wellness and a little bit of winter sports. Andeer is a contemplative village in Southern Switzerland with a thermal bath. This institution was the main reason for us to get there. There were two basins with warm, minerally water and a sauna area.</p>

<p>Not too far from Andeer you can find the mountain village Juf, situated beyond 2100 metres. It is the highest village of Europe which is inhabited all-year. From there we took a winter trail to leave civilization behind us, solely surrounded by snow-covered peaks.</p>

<p>Also close to Andeer is the winter resort Splügen, where we tried skating. It is quite strenuous on the way uphill, but going down really compensates for the effort. It&#8217;s like flying, you slide very easily also with poor technique.</p>
