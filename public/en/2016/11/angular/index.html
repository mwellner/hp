  <p>After my first week at <a href="https://www.conweaver.com/" target="_blank">ConWeaver</a>, I got a first impression of the search framework and the technology used. The hot topic in the moment is <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, which is a web application framework. In contrast to other server-side frameworks, the application logic is on the client (browser). This is a major trend now, aiming at <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/" target="_blank">Progressive Web Apps</a>, which are as quick and responsive as native applications.</p>

<p>To work with Angular, I need to understand the entire ecosystem which has evolved for developing with Angular. <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> is used as an improved version of JavaScript, <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a> for packaging and tooling.</p>

<p>One tool I can heavily recommend is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>. It works on Windows and Linux, has built-in <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> functionality and is just perfect for working with a web project.</p>

<p>Overall, I have found the Linux environment slightly easier to use. On Windows, some Node packages needed to be installed globally with appropriate PATH settings, what was not quite intuitive.</p>

<p>But there are still a lot of things to discover and learn out there.</p>
