  Currently, I am working on a hobby project, a theater production and actor database (mwtdb for short). It is visible on GitHub and open source.
Requirements What I want to create is something similar to IMDb, which focuses on movies, TV and celebreties, but for amateur theater. A very basic version will contain actors, directors and technicians, contributing to productions.
From a technical point of view, I will create a web application, using Angular and Neo4j, a graph database.

  I am currently experimenting with service workers (see Using Service Workers or Service Workers: an Introduction). One scenario is to provide mock data when no connection to an external service is available. And by theory, service workers should be able to intercept any request made by the website.
But there is one exception. If you fetch data with jQuery.ajax() function and use async: false, the service worker will not be able to intercept any of those requests.

  Soon, I will attend the Technical Summit 2016, which will take place from Dec 6 to 8 in Darmstadt. This is my first conference for my new employer (ConWeaver), where I am working pretty much along the same lines as for Comparis, meaning front-end development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and its many derivatives (Sass, LESS, TypeScript). A new challenge is Angular, which has recently reached version 2 and comes with a nodejs-based workflow and with mostly alpha-staged tools around.

  In my current project, I had to deal with huge JSON files, which contain the order and properties of our layout elements. For CSS styling purposes, I had to move one particular array item to the end, create a new object and move all existing elements inside of that new object. This was tedious work when I did that manually.
So I decided to develop a little C# Console application, taking care of that for me.

  After my first week at ConWeaver, I got a first impression of the search framework and the technology used. The hot topic in the moment is Angular, which is a web application framework. In contrast to other server-side frameworks, the application logic is on the client (browser). This is a major trend now, aiming at Progressive Web Apps, which are as quick and responsive as native applications.
To work with Angular, I need to understand the entire ecosystem which has evolved for developing with Angular.

  On Friday, most of the students organizations presented themselves in Squires Student Center. Interested to get involved in something I entered the room. It was packed with people, you could hear music playing from one corner, and a babble of voices was in the air. The organizations were organized in long rows of tables, with every organization only having two meters to present their material.
So I went through, drowned in the many possibilities and smiles.

  Today, I visited a speech given by a Buddhist monk on mindfulness. He was a lank person with bushy fair eye brows. He wore the traditional orange garment and he was shaven-headed. Born in California he experienced the Vietnam war in a state of stonedness far off the battle fields. On a subsequent journey he travelled to Asia and decided after a while to join Buddhism.
His way of talking was deliberate and calm, his hands rested on his lap for the whole time.
