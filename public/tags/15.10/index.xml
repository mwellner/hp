      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the next five days, I will be on an &lt;em&gt;innovation week&lt;/em&gt;, as my company calls it. I will be away from the daily business and dig into one topic of my own choice, but of course related to current challenges within the company. And since service-oriented architecture is something that moves us in the moment, I chose service scalability as my topic. But for that to work, I need a quick way to set-up services within their own context, making it possible to add more service nodes when needed. And after a quick research, I will use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34; title=&#34;Docker&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;docker&lt;/a&gt;, another hot topic in the web industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a working environment, I will use the current version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com/&#34; title=&#34;Ubuntu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ubuntu Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which has the big advantage, that it supports containerization on the operating system level. And I know the system for quite some time, having a dual-boot system with Linux and Windows on my home computer since ages. For this current challenge, I updated to the current version (15.10) and installed docker. That turned out to be not so easy, so I wished I had known this video before, which describes it all in a very elaborated English and with amply detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t spent too much thoughts on the actual application design, but the set-up suggested in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker-birthday-3#challenge&#34; title=&#34;GitHub - docker birthday challenge&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;docker birthday challenge&lt;/a&gt; seems quite interesting and sufficing.&lt;/p&gt;
