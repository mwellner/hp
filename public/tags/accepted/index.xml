      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, we got it through! I now can also reveal that the scientific journal of my choice was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mitpressjournals.org/pres&#34;&gt;Presence&lt;/a&gt;, published by MIT Press. It was a long process, which raised my awareness of scientific language enormously. However, I am not sure whether that is a good thing. I now tend to get on other people&amp;#8217;s nerves when they write something and ask for my opinion on that. There are so many mistakes and inconsistencies to discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there is one written form to express an idea adequately. One form which has exactly the right length. And I wonder, how many iterations it takes to get to that form.&lt;/p&gt;
