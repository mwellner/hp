      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s done. A last-minute demonstration with our new CAVE setup today was a stunning success. Everything worked fine, we could show a simple example of our rowing simulator project. We had the oar displayed on the screen, and a rowing sound was played when it penetrated into the water. Furthermore we could show trees with singing birds and a human figurine making a speech. Considering the minimal preparation time (we switched the whole system on yesterday at 5 PM), this was a remarkable achievement by our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting to see was how people react under pressure. While some got upset I got extremely relaxed. Just too many things were happening, too many conflicting demands arising, so I found myself in a not so much caring mood. Or maybe I did care about too many things at the same time. Anyways, an interesting observation.&lt;/p&gt;
