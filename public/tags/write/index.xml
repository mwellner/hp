      <title>Ten Reasons to Typeset Scientific Texts in LaTeX</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you write a report in a scientific environment, a Master thesis, a journal publication, or a dissertation, you have the choice which text editing tool to use. It comes usually down to Word vs. LaTeX. I will now argue why you should use LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on content, not layout.&lt;/strong&gt; When editing your LaTeX document with the editing program of your choice you can focus on the content. You need to provide some logical markup (this is a section, this is a reference citation), but that is easy to learn. Most Word users tend to focus on layout instead of content and structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free.&lt;/strong&gt; LaTeX is completely free. Just download it and use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No crashes.&lt;/strong&gt; Increasing page numbers and complexity sometimes leads to Word documents that crash and can not be reopened. Imagine this happening one day before you have to submit your thesis!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproducible results.&lt;/strong&gt; When using more advanced features like automatic table of contents, internal references, or automatic managing of bibliographies, Word tends to do changes at unforeseen times, destroying the reformatting work of hours. This will not happen with LaTeX, if you got it to do something it will not change back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better look.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of rules how to create documents that look good. It&amp;#8217;s about margins, aspect ratios of text columns, connecting certain letters and many other things experienced typesetters know. And LaTeX will use these rules, if you let it! So the results just look far better than those created with Word.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better layout of equations.&lt;/strong&gt; Same as above goes for mathematical equations. They just look better. Try this in Word: &lt;div id=&#34;attachment_1854&#34; style=&#34;width: 186px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mwellner.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/formel.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.mwellner.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/formel.png&#34; alt=&#34;Mathematische Formel, gesetzt mit LaTeX&#34; title=&#34;Mathematische Formel&#34; width=&#34;176&#34; height=&#34;50&#34; class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1854&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Mathematische Formel, gesetzt mit LaTeX
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floating environments.&lt;/strong&gt; In LaTeX, you can provide figures or tables and let the system decide where exactly to put them. So there are no empty areas when you add a sentence on a page with an image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Units.&lt;/strong&gt; When you need to report a measure with a unit, you may either write 9.2m or 9.2 m, both looks strange. The solution is an unbreakable half space, like 9.2&amp;thinsp;m. And the LaTeX package units provides an easy command for that and does the typesetting for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference management.&lt;/strong&gt; As a scientist you read lots of papers which you may want to use in your scientific text. I used also once a Word-Endnote combination, but was not satisfied at all. It was impossible to change the location of the references list, since Word would redo my brave attempts to push it to a different space and looking for references needed a lot of clicks. In contrast, LaTeX comes with BibTeX, where you give a key to each reference and can easily cite it with that key. You can also change the way you want to cite, from numbers like [3] to Author names like (Rondel and McDouglas, 1992).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packages for all kinds of special problems.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a multitude of free packages which solve all kind of problems. Want nicer figure captions? Need to typeset chemical formula? Want to cite in APA style? No problem, there are packages around for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>I am going slightly mad</title>
      <link>http://www.mwellner.de/2008/04/i-am-going-slightly-mad/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I resubmitted my manuscript to the journal of my choice. The review process has taken a long time, they were almost satisfied with my paper last time but still required a lot of changes to publish it. So now, it is the third or fourth time, I am resubmitting these pages. There are a lot of changes to the manuscript and I learned, what a post-hoc Tukey test was. So here we go again&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; This paper describes evaluation experiments for visual and auditory feedback in a virtual obstacle walking scenario. Two studies with healthy subjects were carried out using the actuated gait orthosis Lokomat. Controlled factors for the visual feedback experiment were three different perspectives and 2D/3D vision. In the auditory feedback experiment, controlled factors were rhythmic distance feedback and gradual foot clearance feedback. For the visual and auditory feedback experiments, outcome was assessed with task-specific performance parameters and questionnaires. Results for visual feedback indicate that the chosen side perspective is superior to behind and ego perspectives. It is also shown that 3D vision does not reduce the number of obstacle hits compared to 2D vision. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that adding continuous auditory feedback made subjects walk faster compared to the exclusive use of visual feedback. Sujects rated auditory distance feedback as more helpful than auditory foot clearance feedback. Therefore, we suggest to use the side perspective and auditory feedback on obstacle distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has happened before&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resubmission on January 24, 2008&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mwellner.de/2007/08/29/paper-submission/&#34;&gt;Original submission on August 29, 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
